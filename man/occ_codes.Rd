\description{
A dataset of occupation groups and descriptions with both Census (OCC) codes and SOC codes. Occupations are grouped hierarchically. This is filtered from a Census crosswalk to include only top-level groups, except for the very broad management, business, science, and arts occupations group; for this one, the second level groups are treated as the major one. Often you'll just want the major groups, so you can filter by the \code{is_major_grp} column.
