\usage{
qwi_industry(years, industries = naics_codes$industry, counties = NULL,
  state = "09", annual = TRUE, key = Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY"))
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{A numeric vector of one or more years for which to get data}

\item{industries}{A character vector of NAICS industry codes; default is the 20 sectors plus "All industries" from the dataset \code{naics_codes}.}

\item{counties}{A character vector of county FIPS codes.}

\item{state}{A string of a state FIPS code; defaults to \code{"09"} for Connecticut}

\item{annual}{Logical, whether to return annual averages (default) or quarterly data.}

\item{key}{A Census API key. Defaults to the value at \code{"CENSUS_API_KEY"} in your \code{.Renviron} file, as set by \code{tidycensus::census_api_key}.}
}
\value{
A data frame / tibble

\description{
This gets data from the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) via the Census API. It's an alternative to \code{censusapi::getCensus} that fetches a set of variables (employees and payroll) but makes a somewhat more dynamic API call. The API returns a maximum of 10 years of data; calling this function with more than 10 years will require multiple API calls, which takes a little longer.
}
\details{
Note that when looking at data quarterly, the payroll reported will be for that quarter, not the yearly payroll that you may be more accustomed to.
