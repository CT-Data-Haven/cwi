\title{Add inflation-adjusted values to a data frame}
\usage{
adj_inflation(data, value, year, base_year = 2016,
  key = Sys.getenv("BLS_KEY"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing monetary values by year.}

\item{value}{Bare column name of monetary values; for safety, has no default.}

\item{year}{Bare column name of years; for safety, has no default.}

\item{base_year}{Year on which to base inflation amounts; defaults to 2016.}

\item{key}{A string giving the BLS API key. Defaults to the value in \code{Sys.getenv("BLS_KEY")}, as set by \code{blscrapeR::set_bls_key}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two additional columns: adjustment factors, and adjusted values. The adjusted values column is named based on the name supplied as \code{value}; e.g. if \code{value = avg_wage}, the adjusted column is named \code{adj_avg_wage}.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper around \code{\link[blscrapeR:bls_api]{blscrapeR::bls_api()}} modeled after \code{\link[blscrapeR:inflation_adjust]{blscrapeR::inflation_adjust()}} that joins a data frame with an inflation adjustment table, then calculates adjusted values. It returns the original data frame with two additional columns for adjustment factors and adjustment values.

\details{
\strong{Note:} Because \code{adj_inflation} wraps around a function that makes API calls, internet access is required.

  wages <- data.frame(
    year = 2010:2016,
    wage = c(50000, 51000, 52000, 53000, 54000, 55000, 54000)
  )
  adj_inflation(wages, value = wage, year = year, base_year = 2016)
