\arguments{
\item{table}{A string giving the ACS table number.}

\item{year}{The year of the ACS table; currently defaults 2021 (most recent available).}

\item{towns}{A character vector of names of towns to include; \code{"all"} (default) for all towns optionally filtered by county; or \code{NULL} to not fetch town-level table.}

\item{regions}{A named list of regions with their town names (defaults \code{NULL}).}

\item{counties}{A character vector of names of counties to include; \code{"all"} (default) for all counties in the state; or \code{NULL} to not fetch county-level table.}

\item{state}{A string: either name or two-digit FIPS code of a US state. Required; defaults \code{"09"} (Connecticut).}

\item{neighborhoods}{A data frame with columns for neighborhood name, GEOID of either tracts or block groups, and weight, e.g. share of each tract assigned to a neighborhood. If included, weighted sums and MOEs will be returned for neighborhoods. Try to match the formatting of the \link[=neighborhood_tracts]{built-in neighborhood tables}.}

\item{tracts}{A character vector of 11-digit FIPS codes of tracts to include, or \code{"all"} for all tracts optionally filtered by county. Defaults \code{NULL}.}

\item{blockgroups}{A character vector of 12-digit FIPS codes of block groups to include, or \code{"all"} for all block groups optionally filtered by county. Defaults \code{NULL}.}

\item{pumas}{A character vector of 7-digit FIPS codes of public use microdata areas (PUMAs) to include, or \code{"all"} for all PUMAs optionally filtered by county. It's up to you to filter out any redundancies--some large towns are standalone PUMAs, as are some sparsely-population counties. Defaults \code{NULL}.}

\item{msa}{Logical: whether to fetch New England states' metropolitan statistical areas. Defaults \code{FALSE}.}

\item{us}{Logical: whether to fetch US-level table. Defaults \code{FALSE}.}

\item{new_england}{Logical: if \code{TRUE} (the default), limits metro areas to just New England states.}

\item{nhood_name}{String giving the name of the column in the data frame \code{neighborhoods} that contains neighborhood names. Previously this was a bare column name, but for consistency with changes to COG-based FIPS codes, this needs to be a string. Only relevant if a neighborhood weight table is being used. Defaults \code{"name"} to match the neighborhood lookup datasets.}

\item{nhood_geoid}{String giving the name of the column in \code{neighborhoods} that contains neighborhood GEOIDs, either tracts or block groups. Only relevant if a neighborhood weight table is being used. Because of changes to FIPS codes, this no longer has a default.}

\item{nhood_weight}{String giving the name of the column in \code{neighborhoods} that contains weights between neighborhood names and tract/block groups. Only relevant if a neighborhood weight table is being used. Defaults \code{"weight"} to match the neighborhood lookup datasets.}

\item{survey}{A string: which ACS estimate to use. Defaults to 5-year (\code{"acs5"}), but can also be 1-year (\code{"acs1"}).}

\item{verbose}{Logical: whether to print summary of geographies included. Defaults \code{TRUE}.}

\item{key}{String: Census API key. If \code{NULL} (default), takes the value from \code{Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")}.}

\item{sleep}{Number of seconds, if any, to sleep before each API call. This might help with the Census API's tendency to crash, but for many geographies, it could add a sizable about of time. Probably don't add more than a few seconds.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass on to \code{tidycensus::get_acs}}
}
\value{
A tibble with GEOID, name, variable code, estimate, moe, geography level, state, and year, as applicable, for the chosen ACS table.
}
\description{
Fetch a data table from the ACS via \code{tidycensus} with your choice of geographies at multiple levels. For geographies made of aggregates, i.e. neighborhoods made of tracts or regions made of towns, the returned table will have estimates summed and margins of error calculated for the whole area. Any geographic levels that are null will be excluded.
}
\details{
This function essentially calls \code{tidycensus::get_acs()} multiple times, depending on geographic levels chosen, and does minor cleaning, filtering, and aggregation. Note that the underlying \code{tidycensus::get_acs()} requires a Census API key. As is the case with other \code{tidycensus} functions, \code{multi_geo_acs} assumes this key is stored as \code{CENSUS_API_KEY} in your \code{.Renviron}. See \code{\link[tidycensus:census_api_key]{tidycensus::census_api_key()}} for installation.
