\item{survey}{A string: which ACS estimate to use. Defaults to 5-year (\code{"acs5"}), but can also be 1-year (\code{"acs1"}) or 3-year (\code{"acs3"}), though both 1-year and 3-year have limited availability.}

\description{
\code{tidycensus::get_acs} returns an ACS table with its variable codes, which can be joined with \verb{cwi::acs_vars*} to get readable labels. This function is just a quick wrapper around the common task of joining these two data frames.
