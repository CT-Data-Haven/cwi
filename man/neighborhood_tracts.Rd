\description{
Datasets of neighborhoods for New Haven, Hartford/West Hartford, Stamford, and Bridgeport. Some tracts cross between more than one neighborhood; use \code{weight} column for aggregating values such as populations. Previously this included a block group version for New Haven, which I've removed; I'm also renaming \code{nhv_tracts} to \code{new_haven_tracts} for consistency.
}
\details{
These were updated to 2020 tract definitions. There are still 2019 versions of weight tables with names ending in \code{"19"}; for the time being, those will stick around for use with pre-2020 data.
