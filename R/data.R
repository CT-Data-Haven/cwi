#' City neighborhoods by tract
#'
#' Datasets of neighborhoods for New Haven, Hartford/West Hartford, Stamford, and Bridgeport. Some tracts cross between more than one neighborhood; use `weight` column for aggregating values such as populations. Previously this included a block group version for New Haven, which I've removed; I'm also renaming `nhv_tracts` to `new_haven_tracts` for consistency.
#'
#' These were updated to 2020 tract definitions. There are still 2019 versions of weight tables with names ending in `"19"`; for the time being, those will stick around for use with pre-2020 data.
#'
#' Note also that there was an error in the tables for Stamford and Hartford/West Hartford where a few neighborhoods were given extra tracts from outside the town boundaries. This particularly would affect counts, such as population totals by neighborhood, and was based on poor alignment in doing spatial overlays. Fixed 5/22/2024.

#' Zip to town lookup

#' Village to town lookup
#'
#' A crosswalk of Connecticut's Census-designated places (CDP) to the towns (county subdivisions) intersecting with them.
#' With the 2010 boundaries, places were generally each within a single town, but the 2020 boundaries increased the number of places,
#' including ones that span multiple towns. This table now has weights to show how much of a place's population is in the
#' associated town. This version also includes all places, not just ones that differ from the corresponding town.
#' Note that places don't span the full state. All populations are from the 2020 decennial census, and overlaps are based on
#' fitting blocks within places.

#' School districts by town
#'
#' A crosswalk of Connecticut towns and school districts, including regional districts. Some very small towns don't operate their own schools and are not included here, whereas other towns are both part of a regional district and operate some of their own schools, most commonly their own elementary.
#'
#' Note that for aggregating by region, the Hartford-area regional district CREC is not included here, because it spans so many other towns that also run their own schools.CREC is of significant enough size that it should generally be included in Greater Hartford aggregations or as its own district for comparisons alongside e.g. Hartford and West Hartford.

#' Census occupation codes
#'
#' A dataset of occupation groups and descriptions with both Census (OCC) codes and SOC codes. Occupations are grouped hierarchically. This is filtered from a Census crosswalk to include only top-level groups, except for the very broad management, business, science, and arts occupations group; for this one, the second level groups are treated as the major one. Often you'll just want the major groups, so you can filter by the `is_major_grp` column.

#' Proxy PUMAs
#'
#' This is a list of 2 data frames giving PUMAs that make reasonable approximations of designated regions, with weights to apply to both population- and household-based measures. The data frame labeled `county` uses county-based PUMAs and 2021 ACS values; the data frame `cog` uses the new COG-based PUMAs and 2022 ACS values. When working with PUMS data or other weighted surveys, multiply the weights in the proxy table with the weights from the survey to account for how much of the PUMA overlaps the region.
#'
#' The county-based table includes just non-county regions (e.g. Greater New Haven), but the COG-based table also includes "legacy" counties (e.g. New Haven County), since we assume that even if data isn't released for counties, some organizations might still want estimates based on those geographies.
#' See maps of proxies and their weights here: [https://ct-data-haven.github.io/cogs/proxy-geos.html](https://ct-data-haven.github.io/cogs/proxy-geos.html)
