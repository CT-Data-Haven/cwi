## 2019 ACS

### New tables

The 2019 ACS included [reengineering of a few
tables](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2019/5-year.html),
and a few new additions. Some are clarifications of phrasing to both
questions and tables, such as time leaving home for work. More
substantial are the changes in how family structure has been phrased to
be more inclusive of same-sex and unmarried couples–see the most recent
[working
paper](https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/library/working-papers/2017/demo/SEHSD-WP2017-28.html)
on this.

This is just a quick check of what’s new or changed.
