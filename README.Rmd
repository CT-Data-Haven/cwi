[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CT-Data-Haven/cwi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CT-Data-Haven/cwi) [![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/CT-Data-Haven/cwi?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/CT-Data-Haven/cwi)

The goal of `cwi` is to get data, primarily the Census ACS, fetched, aggregated, and analyzed for [DataHaven's 2019 Community Index reports](http://ctdatahaven.org/reports/greater-new-haven-community-index). This includes functions to speed up and standardize analysis for multiple staff people, preview trends and patterns we'll need to write about, and get data in more layperson-friendly formats.

It pairs well with many functions from Camille's brilliantly-named [`camiller`](https://github.com/camille-s/camiller) package.

## Installation

You can install this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/CT-Data-Haven/cwi) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CT-Data-Haven/cwi")
```

## Dependencies

This package relies heavily on:

* The [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org/) packages, namely `magrittr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, `stringr`, `forcats`, and `ggplot2` (version >= 3.0.0) (so basically *all* the tidyverse)
* `rlang` and `tidyselect` for non-standard evaluation in many functions
* `tidycensus` for actually getting all the Census data
* `sf` isn't required but it's encouraged

## Data

`cwi` ships with several datasets and shapefiles. These include:

* Shapes (as `sf` objects) of towns, tracts, and city neighborhoods for New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport, and Stamford
* Common ACS table numbers—hopefully decreases time spent prowling around [FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov)
* Definitions of neighborhoods by tract or block group, and of regions by town

## Sources

This package contains functions to make it easier and more reproducible to fetch and analyze data from:

* [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) (US Census Bureau)
* [Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html) (US Census Bureau)
* [Quarterly Workforce Indicators](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/) (US Census Bureau Center for Economic Studies)
* [Local Area Unemployment Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/lau/) (Bureau of Labor Statistics)

More to come (as of 7/17/2018) may include simplifications of working with [LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) (LODES) and ACS public use microdata samples (PUMS) via [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/).

## Example

Here's an example of getting a big table to calculate homeownership rates across many geographies at once:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(cwi)
```

```{r fetch, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
tenure <- multi_geo_acs(
  table = basic_table_nums$tenure,
  year = 2018,
  regions = regions[c("Greater New Haven", "New Haven Inner Ring", "New Haven Outer Ring")],
  counties = "New Haven",
  towns = regions[["Greater New Haven"]],
  us = TRUE
)
tenure
```


```{r homeownership_rates}
homeownership <- tenure %>%
  label_acs() %>%
  group_by(level, NAME) %>%
  mutate(share = estimate / estimate[1]) %>% # or use camiller::calc_shares
  filter(str_detect(label, "Owner")) %>%
  select(level, name = NAME, share)

homeownership
```

```{r geo_plot}
geo_level_plot(homeownership, value = share, hilite = "#EA7FA2", 
               title = "Homeownership in Greater New Haven, 2018")
```
